# Welcome to my github profile.

Im just some nerd who sometimes does some coding from time to time.

I dabble in reverse engineering, ethical hacking and game modding from time to time whenever the mood strikes.

Not as active on github as i used to be due to being burnt out of coding and not having less free time.
